sniffio: Sniff out which async library your code is running under

You're writing a library. You've decided to be ambitious, and support multiple async I/O packages, like Trio, and asyncio, and ... You've written a bunch of clever code to handle all the differences. But... how do you know which piece of clever code to run?

This is a tiny package whose only purpose is to let you detect which async library your code is running under.
